            <p class="description">
                HTML5 has no secrets for me, i use it
                all the time with proper blocks and
                names. New features and attributes are
                always welcome to make things easier

            <p class="description">
                When it comes to styling, there is no
                other than CSS. Very powerful and easy
                to use. Also from CSS3 there are many
                aniamtion tools that i love

            <p class="lang"> JS </p>
            <p class="description">
                JS for me is sth that adds life to a website, controls the behaviour and can do things that CSS can't. I'm familiar with ES6 and some frameworks
